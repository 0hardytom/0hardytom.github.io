__Hello!__ I'm a __fourth-year physics with astronomy MPhys__ student at __Durham University__ broadly interested in __observation-led astronomy in the Large Survey Era__ (this usually involves high-z galaxies, exoplanets or AGN emission). 

With three summers' research experience (including at __Cambridge's IoA__ and __Oxford Astrophysics__), I've covered a range of fields, including _simulation-based-inference for LIGO_, building a _HI source extraction pipeline for MeerKAT_ and solving the _light-transfer-time equation to find third bodies in binary orbit timing_.  Currently, I’m working on a master’s thesis using __VLT-MUSE extreme emission line galaxies (Green Peas) as spectral analogues for JWST epoch of reionization candidates__, supervised by [Prof Alastair Edge](https://astro.dur.ac.uk/~ace/). I am incredibly excited about the future of astrophysics, and spend a lot of my time being inspired by the work of others. 

At Durham I chair the [SVC (Staff-Student Consultative/Student Voice Committee)](https://durhamuniversity.sharepoint.com/teams/PhysicsHub/SitePages/Student-Staff-Consultative-Committee-(SSCC).aspx) (internal link!) with [Prof Alis Deason](https://alisdeason.wixsite.com/home), where I lead a team of 10-20 student reps across the physics department and help deliver one of the department’s induction lectures as part of [orientation week](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/welcome/). I also sit on the staff Board of Studies (under the HoD [Prof Paula Chadwick](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/p-m-chadwick/)) and in previous years with [Prof Marek Szablewski](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/marek-szablewski/) have consulted on key changes to curriculum and the student experience at Durham Physics. __Please get in touch with my Durham institutional email (thomas \[dot\] hardy)  if you have feedback about departmental student experience__. I am especially keen to hear from new starters about the fresher’s week process for entry in 2026.

__You may also be here for my music work!__ I’m a respected commercial composer, arranger, transcriber and engraver. I’ve headlined Ronnie Scott’s twice with NYJO, been commissioned by Young-Euro (which saw my music played at the Berlin Konzerthaus and on DeutschlandRadio), and won the Au Composition Competition (an international big band arranging competition) in summer 2025. With [Callum Au](https://callumaumusic.com/) I’ve done music preparation and engraving for the Metropole Orkest, the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Netherlands Air Force Orchestra.

At Durham I am immensely privileged to lead (2024-26) one of the __UK’s premier student Big Bands, DUBB__, and the newly formed __Studio Orchestra__. My work on DUBB’s 2024-5 tour ‘Unspoken Voices’ won me the __Full Palatinate__ (full colours) for ‘Outstanding Achievement in Music’, and ensembles under my leadership have seen __6 palatinate nominations and 2 half-palatinate wins__. I also led the Jazz Orchestra (2023-24) and held the creative directorship for DuJazzSoc (2022-23). I am really passionate about arts and culture outreach in County Durham, and have helped raise over £3,000 in charity events.
