## Lay Summary

I spent the summer of the second year of university as a rresearch Intern in Hintze centre for Astrophysical Surveys/Galaxies sub-group. I built Catherine Hale and Matt Jarvis' PHiSEP (Profound HI source extraction pipeline), a neutral hydrogen source extraction pipeline using Aaron Robotham's [```ProFound```](https://github.com/asgr/ProFound/tree/master). The project was initally designed to evaluate the effectivity of segmentation extractors on HI-datacubes, and led to the development of an MPI-enabled HPC pipeline (using python and R) for MIGHTEE-HI/COSMOS data using Oxford's Glamdring Cluster. I additionally attended the Breakthrough Discuss and Steven Balbus conferences.

## Project Details
