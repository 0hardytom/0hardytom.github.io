## Lay Summary

This project formed the summer of my 3rd undergraduate year, and was carried out as part of an IoA summer studentship at Cambridge. I developed neural networks to process complex-valued frequency-domain gravitational wave data and detect both localised and model-wide distortions within a frequentist statistical framework by using simulation based inference (inference from simulation-trained neural density estimators to evaluate the posterior predictive distribution). Use of torch, jax, ripple, jimgw and multiprocessing to carry out high-performance GPU computing. Following my end-of-project presentation I was invited back to speak at the IoA's 30-year anniversary event, alongside Prof Nikku Madhusudhan and Dr Will Handley. The project is an extension of the Anau-Montel, Alvey & Weniger library [```mist```](https://github.com/NoemiAM/mist/tree/main)
