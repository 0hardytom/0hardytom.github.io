Developed neural networks to process complex frequency-domain gravitational wave data and detect both localised and model-wide distortions within a frequentist statistical framework. Use of torch, jax, ripple, jimgw and multiprocessing to carry out high-performance GPU computing. Following my end-of-project presentation I was invited back to speak at the IoA's 30-year anniversary event, alongside Prof Nikku Madhusudhan and Dr Will Handley. Supervised by Dr James Alvey"

I built Catherine Hale and Matt Jarvis' PHiSEP, a neutral hydrogen source extraction pipeline using Aaron Robotham's ProFound. The project was initally designed to evaluate the effectivity of segmentation extractors on HI-datacubes, and led to the development of an MPI-enabled HPC pipeline (using python and R) for MIGHTEE-HI/COSMOS, and simulated SKA data. Attended the Breakthrough Discuss and Steven Balbus conferences. Supervised by Dr Catherine Hale, Dr Anastasia Ponomareva and Prof Matt Jarvis."

The project involved use of python regex infrastructure to transcribe large PDF data (for analysis); large scale non-numerical data storage; and GPT-API usage. Submitted to the Journal of Physics Education in mid 2023 and published in early 2024; this project also led to a current Laidlaw Scholarship project utilising the data to train specialist GPTs.

From Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), its potential implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest. This study delves into the capabilities of AI in physics education and offers actionable AI policy recommendations. Using openAIâ€™s flagship gpt-3.5-turbo large language model (LLM), we assessed its ability to answer 1337 physics exam questions spanning general certificate of secondary education (GCSE), A-Level, and introductory university curricula.
